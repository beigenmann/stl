# Summary

This is a remix of [SerafinG's](http://www.thingiverse.com/SerafinG/about) [Qi Wireless Charger Cradle](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1323186). The original design was made for an "Audew Q5" charger and a Samsung S6, while this one is made in OpenSCAD and can be customized for any charger, phone, and tilt angle. This design was redesigned from scratch using SerafinG's photo only (...I did not use the STL), so there will be a few minor differences.

The default settings are meant for a [generic Qi Charger](http://www.ebay.com/itm/252391502790) and a Samsung S6, but pretty much [any charger](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&_nkw=qi+charger&_sop=15) and phone should work.

The design prints with no support and only a very small bridge. Works great with ABS and should be just as good with PLA.
